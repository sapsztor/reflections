Masodik commit

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If somebody makes commit on that same branch.

fork - makes a new clone into my account on github.
clones - makes a local copy of remote on github.
brach - makes a new path on the local repository.
